### Genos - The Rebellious Bot

This is a puzzle solving platformer game as our submission for the IEEE GameJam 2023.

The theme was "Its not supposed to do that"

In the game you will play as a robot. And you will be given some instructions. Matching with the theme you are not supposed to do what you are told?

Then what do you have to do to complete a level? Well you have to figure it out yourself from ghe insructions, surroundings, or by try-and-error
